AmborellaExpressionDB
=====================

An shiny interface to access gene expression data for Amborella. Currently, you can query a Cuffdiff .db object for a gene name and it will return a ggplot2 object of FPKM expression. 

Future plans include integration of CpG/CHG/CHH methylation bigwig plots and gene model annotation figures.
